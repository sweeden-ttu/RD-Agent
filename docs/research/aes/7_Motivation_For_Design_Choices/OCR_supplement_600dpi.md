7. Motivation for design choices

In the following subsections, we will motivate the choice of the specific transformations and
constants. We believe that the cipher structure does not offer enough degrees of freedom to
hide a trap door.

7.1 The reduction polynomial ™(x )

The polynomial m(x ) (‘11B’) for the multiplication in GF(2°) is the first one of the list of
irreducible polynomials of degree 8, given in [LINi86, p. 378].

7.2 The ByteSub S-box
The design criteria for the S-box are inspired by differential and linear cryptanalysis on the one
hand and attacks using algebraic manipulations, such as interpolation attacks, on the other:

1. Invertibility;

2. Minimisation of the largest non-trivial correlation between linear combinations of

input bits and linear combination of output bits;

3. Minimisation of the largest non-trivial value in the EXOR table;

4. Complexity of its algebraic expression in GF(2°):

5. Simplicity of description.
In [Ny94] several methods are given to construct S-boxes that satisfy the first three criteria. For
invertible S-boxes operating on bytes, the maximum input/output correlation can be made as
low as 2~° and the maximum value in the EXOR table can be as low as 4 (corresponding to a
difference propagation probability of 2°),
We have decided to take from the candidate constructions in [Ny94] the S-box defined by the
mapping x => x in GF(2°).
By definition, the selected mapping has a very simple algebraic expression. This enables
algebraic manipulations that can be used to mount attacks such as interpolation attacks
[JaKn97]. Therefore, the mapping is modified by composing it with an additional invertible
affine transformation. This affine transformation does not affect the properties with respect tot
the first three criteria, but if properly chosen, allows the S-box to satisfy the fourth criterion.
We have chosen an affine mapping that has a very simple description per se, but a
complicated algebraic expression if combined with the ‘inverse’ mapping. It can be seen as
modular polynomial multiplication followed by an addition:

b(x) =(x' +x°4x° +x) 4¢a(xi(x' +x° 42° 4+x° 41) modx* +1

The modulus has been chosen as the simplest modulus possible. The multiplication polynomial
has been chosen from the set of polynomials coprime to the modulus as the one with the
simplest description. The constant has been chosen in such a way that that the S-box has no
fixed points (S-box(a) = a) and no ’opposite fixed points' (S-box(a) = a ).
Note: other S-boxes can be found that satisfy the criteria above. In the case of suspicion of a
trapdoor being built into the cipher, the current S-box might be replaced by another one. The
cipher structure and number of rounds as defined even allow the use of an S-box that does
not optimise the differential and linear cryptanalysis properties (criteria 2 and 3). Even an S-
box that is “average” in this respect is likely to provide enough resistance against differential
and linear cryptanalysis.

7.3 The MixColumn transformation
MixColumn has been chosen from the space of 4-byte to 4-byte linear transformations
according to the following criteria:

1. Invertibility;

2. Linearity in GF(2);

3. Relevant diffusion power;

4. Speed on 8-bit processors;

5. Symmetry;

6. Simplicity of description.
Criteria 2, 5 and 6 have lead us to the choice to polynomial multiplication modulo x‘+1. Criteria
1, 3 and 4 impose conditions on the coefficients. Criterion 4 imposes that the coefficients have
small values, in order of preference ‘00’, ’01’, ’02’, ’03’...The value ‘00’ implies no processing
at all, for ‘01’ no multiplication needs to be executed, ‘02’ can be implemented using xtime
and ‘03’ can be implemented using xtime and an additional EXOR.
The criterion 3 induces a more complicated conditions on the coefficients.
7.3.1 Branch number
In our design strategy, the following property of the linear transformation of MixColumn is
essential. Let F be a linear transformation acting on byte vectors and let the byte weight of a
vector be the number of nonzero bytes (not to be confused with the usual significance of
Hamming weight, the number of nonzero bits). The byte weight of a vector is denoted by W( a).
The Branch Number of a linear transformation is a measure of its diffusion power:
Definition: The branch number of a linear transformation F is

MUN, (W(a) + WF(a))).

A non-zero byte is called an active byte. For MixColumn it can be seen that if a state is applied
with a single active byte, the output can have at most 4 active bytes, as MixColumn acts on the
columns independently. Hence, the upper bound for the branch number is 5. The coefficients
have been chosen in such a way that the upper bound is reached. If the branch number is 5, a
difference in 1 input (or output) byte propagates to all 4 output (or input) bytes, a 2-byte input
(or output) difference to at least 3 output (or input) bytes. Moreover, a linear relation between
input and output bits involves bits from at least 5 different bytes from input and output.
7.4 The ShiftRow offsets
The choice from all possible combinations has been made based on the following criteria:

1. The four offsets are different and cO =0;

2. Resistance against attacks using truncated differentials [Kn95];

3. Resistance against the Square attack [DaKnRi97];

4. Simplicity.

For certain combinations, attacks using truncated differentials can tackle more rounds
(typically only one) than for other combinations. For certain combinations the Square attack
can tackle more rounds than others. From the combinations that are best with respect to
criteria 2 and 3, the simplest ones have been chosen.

7.5 The key expansion

The key expansion specifies the derivation of the Round Keys in terms of the Cipher Key. Its
function is to provide resistance against the following types of attack:

e Attacks in which part of the Cipher Key is known to the cryptanalyst;

e Attacks where the Cipher Key is known or can be chosen, e.g., if the cipher is used
as the compression function of a hash function[Kn95a];

¢ Related-key attacks [Bi93], [KeScWa96]. A necessary condition for resistance
against related-key attacks is that there should not be two different Cipher Keys that
have a large set of Round Keys in common.

The key expansion also plays an important role in the elimination of symmetry:

e Symmetry in the round transformation: the round transformation treats all bytes of a
state in very much the same way. This symmetry can be removed by having round
constants in the key schedule;

e Symmetry between the rounds: the round transformation is the same for all rounds.
This equality can be removed by having round-dependent round constants in the
key schedule.

The key expansion has been chosen according to the following criteria:

e It shall use an invertible transformation, i.e., Knowledge of any Nk consecutive words
of the Expanded Key shall allow to regenerate the whole table;

¢ Speed on a wide range of processors;

¢ Usage of round constants to eliminate symmetries;

e Diffusion of Cipher Key differences into the Round Keys;

¢ Knowledge of a part of the Cipher Key or Round Key bits shall not allow to calculate
many other Round Key bits.

e Enough non-linearity to prohibit the full determination of Round Key differences from
Cipher Key differences only;

e Simplicity of description.

In order to be efficient on 8-bit processors, a light-weight, byte oriented expansion scheme has
been adopted. The application of SubByte ensures the non-linearity of the scheme, without
adding much space requirements on an 8-bit processor.

7.6 Number of rounds

We have determined the number of rounds by looking at the maximum number of rounds for
which shortcut attacks have been found and added a considerable security margin. (A shortcut
attack is an attack more efficient than exhaustive key search.)

For Rijndael with a block length and key length of 128 bits, no shortcut attacks have been
found for reduced versions with more than 6 rounds. We added 4 rounds as a security margin.
This is a conservative approach, because:

¢ Two rounds of Rijndael provide “full diffusion” in the following sense: every state bit
depends on all state bits two rounds ago, or, a change in one state bit is likely to
affect half of the state bits after two rounds. Adding 4 rounds can be seen as
adding a “full diffusion” step at the beginning and at the end of the cipher. The high
diffusion of a Rijndael round is thanks to its uniform structure that operates on all
state bits. For so-called Feistel ciphers, a round only operates on half of the state
bits and full diffusion can at best be obtained after 3 rounds and in practice it
typically takes 4 rounds or more.

¢ Generally, linear cryptanalysis, differential cryptanalysis and truncated differential
attacks exploit a propagation trail through n rounds in order to attack n+1 or n+2
rounds. This is also the case for the Square attack that uses a 4-round propagation
structure to attack 6 rounds. In this respect, adding 4 rounds actually doubles the
number of rounds through which a propagation trail has to be found.

For Rijndael versions with a longer Key, the number of rounds is raised by one for every
additional 32 bits in the Cipher Key, for the following reasons:

e One of the main objectives is the absence of shortcut attacks, i.e., attacks that are
more efficient than exhaustive key search. As with the key length the workload of
exhaustive key search grows, shortcut attacks can afford to be less efficient for
longer keys.

¢ Known-key (partially) and related-key attacks exploit the knowledge of cipher key
bits or ability to apply different cipher keys. If the cipher key grows, the range of
possibilities available to the cryptanalyst increases.

As no threatening known-key or related-key attacks have been found for Rijndael, even for 6
rounds, this is a conservative margin.

For Rijndael versions with a higher block length, the number of rounds is raised by one for
every additional 32 bits in the block length, for the following reasons:

¢ Fora block length above 128 bits, it takes 3 rounds to realise full diffusion, i.e., the
diffusion power of a round, relative to the block length, diminishes with the block
length.

e The larger block length causes the range of possible patterns that can be applied at
the input/output of a sequence of rounds to increase. This added flexibility may allow
to extend attacks by one or more rounds.

We have found that extensions of attacks by a single round are even hard to realise for the
maximum block length of 256 bits. Therefore, this is a conservative margin.
